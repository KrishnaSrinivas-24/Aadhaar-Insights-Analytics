UIDAI ANOMALY DETECTION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Identify unusual patterns in Aadhaar enrolment and update data that may indicate:
- System errors or data quality issues
- Potential fraudulent activity
- Operational inefficiencies at specific locations

METHODOLOGY:
- Isolation Forest algorithm (unsupervised ML)
- Features: Total count, Z-score, State deviation, District deviation
- Contamination rate: 1% (flag top 1% most unusual records)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Anomalies cluster in specific districts - suggesting localized issues
2. High-volume states (UP, Maharashtra) have more anomalies but lower rate
3. Small states sometimes show higher anomaly rates - needs investigation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Audit flagged records for data quality issues
2. Investigate top anomalous districts for potential fraud
3. Review equipment and processes at high-anomaly centers
4. Implement real-time anomaly monitoring system
